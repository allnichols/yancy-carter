title: Wages and Compensation
---
We expect to be paid for our work. And while most companies quickly resolve wage mistakes, there are some that intentionally fail to do so. Under the Texas Labor Code, if you are performing a service for compensation you are considered an employee and have the right to be paid for the work you completed.

Whether your paychecks seem to be getting less and less or you were not compensated for overtime, your employer may be intentionally withholding funds. If this is the case, you may have grounds for a civil lawsuit against your employer. Call me today to discuss your legal options as an employee.  

### How Do I Know if My Employer Owes Me Money?
Wage and compensation disputes are not always related to a missed paycheck. In many cases, an employer may skim off an hour or two in hopes you and other employees do not notice. 

Other common examples of unpaid wages include: 

- Ignoring overtime pay
- Failing to pay minimum wage 
- Underpaying tipped employees 
- Failing to give paycheck at the end of employment 
- Refusing to pay reimbursements for business expenses 
- Failing to pay an employee who worked through lunch 
- Failing to pay salary at agreed rate
- Changing bonus criteria after performing work to qualify for the bonus
- Misclassifying an employee as someone who is exempt from overtime 
- Failing to pay commissions 

Commission is commonly used as an incentive to have employees make more deals or perform to a certain level. Often times a dispute about unpaid commission stems from an employee not receiving left over commission after they’ve left a company. If your position is based on commission, its important you understand the terms and conditions surrounding commissions employment agreement.

### Can my Employer Take my Tips?
The tips you receive as a tipped employee belong solely to you – your employer is not allowed to take them. The only exception is if your employer takes part in a valid tip pool. But even then, your employer cannot take money from the pool. 

To qualify for tips, though, your position must customarily and regularly receive tips. As a tipped employee, the [Federal Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/compliance-assistance/handy-reference-guide-flsa) (FLSA) requires your employer to pay a minimum of $2.13 an hour and $5.76 an hour for overtime. Keep in mind the $2.13 an hour must be at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour when combined with tips.

Whether your employer failed to pay you overtime or refused to repay business expenses, you have the right to these funds. In Texas, you have two years from the day of your employer’s unlawful act to file a civil claim. Give me a call to discuss your legal options. I understand that what you have been through is unprecedented. I will work tirelessly on your behalf to ensure you receive the compensation you are entitled too and that your employer is brought to justice.
