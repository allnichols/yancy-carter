title: Wrongful Termination
---
As employees, we hope to be judged based on our work performance rather than characteristics like race or sexual orientation. Though we may be fired for things like tardiness or failed performance, some employers may terminate you based on protected characteristics – which is illegal in Texas.

The act of being fired is not illegal in Texas – even if you don’t agree with the reason. That being said though, the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) protects you from being fired because of your race/color, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, national origin, disability or pregnancy. Contact legal representation right away if this has been the case for you. You may have grounds for a civil lawsuit.   

### What is Considered Wrongful Termination?
Your employment in Texas is considered at-will, unless stated otherwise in a contract – meaning you can be fired at any time. However, state and federal law prevent your employer from terminating your employment for certain reasons.

The [Texas Workforce Commission](https://www.twc.state.tx.us/news/efte/wrongful_discharge.html), for example, states you cannot be fired for the following reasons:

- Discriminatory reasons 
- Filing various claims against an employer (workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, OSHA, etc.)
- Engaging in union activity 
- Jury duty 
- Military duty 
- Refusing to commit a criminal act 
- If the firing violates a contractual agreement 

You have the right to file a claim even if you quit your job. This only applies to limited circumstances that involve resigning because the workplace was so hostile you felt there was no other choice. This is called a constructive discharge and requires substantial evidence to prove your employer created a hostile work environment.

### Remedies for Wrongful Termination in Texas
There are multiple options available if a judge concludes you were wrongfully terminated. Per the Texas Workforce Commission, you are entitled to the following types of compensation:

- Job reinstatement 
- Back and future pay
- Promotion
- Punitive damages 
- Injunction against future legal conduct
