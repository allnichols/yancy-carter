title: 'Hostile Work Environment'
---
It’s not uncommon to complain about a bad boss or negative place of employment, but there are certain behaviors that may constitute a hostile work environment – which is illegal under Texas and federal law. 

We want to feel comfortable at our jobs, but when the environment becomes hostile to the point you can no longer perform your duties or the environment is no longer comfortable, you may have grounds for a civil lawsuit. Speaking with an employment lawyer is the first step to determine if you have a case. I will take the time to listen to your story and develop a legal strategy to hold your employer accountable.

### What is a Hostile Work Environment?
It’s important to understand the legal requirements that constitute a hostile work environment. For starters, you must have been subjected to an offensive or intimidating work environment by a superior or co-workers and this behavior must have discriminated against a protected class, including:

- Race/Color
- Religion
- Sexual Orientation
- Sex 
- National Origin
- Disability
- Pregnancy

The behavior or communication creating a hostile work environment must be pervasive, lasting and not limited to an off-color remark. Not only this, but the hostility must severely disrupt your work, ability to work or career progress 

A key element to proving a hostile work environment is that your employer had the opportunity to remedy the situation but failed to do so. If you have spoken up about what’s taking place at your job, filed a complaint with human resources or supervisor and the complaint has failed to be addressed or was inadequately addressed, contact an employment law to discuss your rights as an employee. 

### Behavior That May Indicate a Hostile Work Environment
A hostile work environment is more than just a rude employee or supervisor. Keep in mind the offensive or intimidating behaviors must discriminate against a protected classification. From being harassed because of your race to not being promoted because you’re pregnant, there are a range or behaviors that constitute a hostile work environment. Other behaviors include:

- Intimidation, ridicule and mockery 
- Insults, slurs and name calling
- Interference with work performance
- Touching, physical assaults and threats
- Using sexual language

It is not uncommon for a supervisor or co-worker to use intimidation or harassment to try and force you to quit your job following a complaint. Keep in mind it is illegal to retaliate against someone for filing a discrimination suit, testifying or participating in an investigation of lawsuit.

Speaking with an employment lawyer is the best way to determine if you have grounds for a civil suit. I understand what you have been through is unprecedented, which is why I vow to work tirelessly on your behalf to ensure your employer is held accountable and that you receive the compensation you deserve.
