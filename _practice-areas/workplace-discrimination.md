title: 'Workplace Discrimination'
---
We expect an employer to see us for our skills and experience rather than attributes like race and gender. Though most do, there are some employers who will discriminate against employees and potential employees based on characteristics protected by state and federal law. 

Being discriminated against in the workplace can cause tremendous emotion and financial harm. You may have the right to compensation. I will work with you every step of the way to ensure your employer is held accountable and that you receive maximum compensation. 

### What is Considered Workplace Discrimination Under Texas Law?
When it comes to workplace discrimination, the [Texas Labor Code](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/LA/htm/LA.21.htm) mirrors federal standards enforced by the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964).  In the state of Texas, an employer is prohibited from discriminating against an employee or potential employee based on the following attributes:

- Race 
- Age
- Sex
- Sexual orientation 
- Religion 
- Disability
- Place of origin
- Pregnancy

### Examples of Workplace Discrimination 
From being fired because of the color of your skin to being verbally harassed because of a disability, workplace discrimination can take many forms. However, it is only considered workplace discrimination if it is done basic on a protected characteristic. Common examples include:

- Being fired 
- Having hours reduced 
- Job refusal 
- Denial of training opportunities, promotions or transfer
- Being paid less than someone with the same job, experience and qualifications 
- Being subject to abuse or verbal harassment that references protected characteristic
